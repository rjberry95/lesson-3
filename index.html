				<p>This will serve as a little exercise to see how well all this stuff is clicking, in addition to getting you comfortable with some more advanced styling techniques. This is a screenshot of a site.</p>

				<p>Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.</p>

			<h6>2. This is a photo of a cat</h6>
			<div class="section">
				<p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like width: 100%;. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like font-family: monospace;.</p>
				<img src="images/cat.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"/>

			<h6>3. This is a big link</h6>
			<div class="section">
				<p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.</p>
				<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Take me to Google</a>
